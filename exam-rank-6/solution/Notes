int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,
           fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);

fd_set

	A bitmask representing a set of file descriptors.

	You can monitor:

	Read: Is data available to read? (e.g. recv())

	Write: Is it okay to write without blocking? (e.g. send())

	Except: Exceptional condition (rarely used for TCP).

You manipulate fd_set using these macros:

Macro				Description
FD_ZERO(&set)		Clear all fds from the set
FD_SET(fd, &set)	Add fd to the set
FD_CLR(fd, &set)	Remove fd from the set
FD_ISSET(fd, &set)	Check if fd is in the set (after select)

Param				Description
nfds				Highest fd + 1 (used to know how many fds to scan)
readfds				FDs to check for readability
writefds			FDs to check for writability
exceptfds			FDs to check for exceptional conditions
timeout				NULL = wait forever. Zeroed = poll. Can set delay.


int sprintf(char *str, const char *format, ...);
- It works just like printf() with format specifiers (%d, %s, etc.).
- Instead of printing to the screen, it writes formatted text to a char buffer.
- The resulting string is null-terminated (\0).
- Returns the number of characters written (excluding the null byte).
